"""Generate a .man in-game Manual/Guide asset for the sd2snes+ Manual viewer.

CICLO 2 CONTRATO RECONCILIADO (IN-GAME-MENU-PLANO.md): version byte stays 1
FOREVER pre-release (the LAYOUT is free to change -- it's just regenerated
assets, never a "v2" in name/byte). This encodes the reconciled format:
  - header 40B (was 16B): adds flags (zoom bit), zoom_nblocks, and a 24B
    FONT-ENCODED title (ACCENTS scheme, mirrors snes/utils/build_const.py).
  - index entries keep 8B but the reserved byte becomes `zflags` (zoom
    metadata: bit0=is-zoom bit1=column bit2=row).
  - optional --zoom: a SEAM-LOCKED re-render of each band at 512-wide (same cut
    points, doubled) so the viewer can offer a legible 2x zoom without
    re-deciding line breaks. The zoom section is a SCROLLABLE 4bpp page (see
    below), not a grid of screens.
  - multiple guides per ROM are just multiple .man files side by side
    (<stem>.man + <stem>.NN.man, NN 02..08) -- out of scope for this
    single-file encoder; the title lives in EACH file's header.

The Manual viewer (in-game overlay, GUIDES tab) is a mode-3 8bpp PALETTED
image viewer, streamed block-by-block from the SD card while the game is
frozen. This host converter renders a PDF manual FIT-TO-WIDTH 256px (the
geometry proven legible in the design experiments) and slices each page into
224px-tall "bands", each band a self-contained fixed-size block ready for a
straight DMA to VRAM.

Pipeline (encode):
  pdftoppm -png -scale-to-x 256 -scale-to-y -1 <pdf>  ->  one 256xH image / page.
  Per page: cut into 224px bands.  The band boundary is SMART-SEAMed: the cut is
    snapped to the cleanest (fewest dark pixels) scanline in [224-16, 224], so a
    text line is never split across two bands.  Last band of a page is partial.
  Per band: PIL median-cut to 256 colors (no dither), snap the 256 palette
    entries to 15-bit BGR555, pad the band to 224px with the dominant background
    color, emit 896 tiles (32x28) of 8bpp indices in TILE ORDER.
  --zoom (opt-in): ALSO render at 512-wide (2x). The zoom image is the WHOLE
    PDF PAGE, NOT a band: the viewer pans continuously over all of it with
    hardware scroll. (Cutting zoom at band boundaries made the view jump at the
    half-way point of every page -- do not reintroduce that.) A page taller than
    the resident budget is split into several zoom pages.
  --spread auto|on|off (default auto): a PDF page whose aspect (w/h) crosses
    SPREAD_AR is a 2-page spread scan laid flat; fit-width would squeeze each
    printed page into HALF the pixel budget (illegible after quantization).
    Split pages are re-rendered at double width (512/1024) and emitted as TWO
    pages (left, right) -- each half IS one printed page, so the emitted
    sequence stays the book's own pagination and each gets the full budget.

Block layout (fixed 57856 B = 113 * 512, sector-aligned; 1x and zoom blocks
are byte-for-byte the SAME shape, so the viewer's block-DMA path is unchanged
by zoom):
  palette  256 * 2B  BGR555 little-endian   (512 B)

Zoom section (scrollable). The viewer holds ONE zoom page resident in PSRAM and
pans over ALL of it with hardware scroll. A zoom page is a WHOLE PDF PAGE at 2x

taller than ZMAX_ROWS*8 px is split into consecutive zoom pages.

    +19 1 nblk_in_page  how many 1x blocks cover this page, so leaving zoom can return to the

  point, i.e. where panning should start when you press Y on 1x block b:
    +0 2 zoom page      +2 2 Y within that page, in 2x pixels

Per page, every base sector-aligned:
  palette  8*16 BGR555 LE = 256B (padded to 512)
  attrs    nrows * 64B -- ONE BYTE PER TILE, value = palette << 2 (pre-shifted;
           the viewer must rewrite the tilemap row on every row load anyway
           because the palette bits change when a ring slot is reused, so a
           pre-shifted byte makes that work cheap instead of a bit-unpack)
  tiles    nrows * 2048B. Each row is PRE-SPLIT: 32 tiles (cols 0-31, 1024B)
           then 32 tiles (cols 32-63, 1024B). The viewer's 512px width does not
           fit one BG layer (a tilemap entry's character field is 10 bits = 1024
           tiles max), so the halves land on BG1 and BG2 and are joined by a
           window -- pre-splitting makes each half one contiguous MCU copy.

Compat (both directions clean, which is why bit0 is retired rather than reused):
  old firmware + new file -> bit0=0 and +14=0 -> "no zoom"; the 1x index stride
    and block format are byte-identical, so 1x viewing still works fully.
  new firmware + old file -> bit1=0 -> no zoom; 1x works. New firmware must
    ignore bit0 entirely so it never feeds legacy 8bpp quadrants to the new path.

    Method -- collapse to a 128-colour MASTER space first, then every per-tile
    decision is small matrix algebra over 128 colours instead of a per-pixel
    nearest-colour search. That is what makes 8-palettes-of-16 affordable:
    the naive form is ~100x slower for the same answer.

      1. master median-cut to 128 colours -> m_idx[H,512], m_rgb[128,3]
      2. hist[t][m] = per-tile histogram over the master colours
      3. seed the 8 palettes from luma-sorted, pixel-count-weighted runs
      4. ZLLOYD_ITERS fixed iterations of:
           cost[m][g] = min_c dist(m_rgb[m], pal[g][c])
           grp        = argmin_g (hist @ cost)      <- ONE matmul, all tiles
           pal[g]     = weighted median cut of the master colours g's tiles use
      5. emit through a pure LUT

    Step 4's re-assignment is the quality lever: every tile independently
    re-picks the best of all 8 palettes each iteration, so the seed only has to
    be reasonable, not good. No RNG anywhere and a fixed iteration count, so the
    same PDF always produces the same bytes.

    Entry 0 of EVERY palette is forced to the page background. In mode 1, colour
    index 0 of a BG palette is transparent and would show the backdrop -- pinning
    background there (and setting CGRAM[0] to the same colour) makes that
    invisible and makes the bottom-of-page padding uniform."""
