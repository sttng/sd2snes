   PATCH_TYPE_* on a match, -1 otherwise.

   Pure string code, no I/O, so the host tests can cover it -- which matters because
   the last rule below is subtle enough to get wrong silently (cut at the FIRST dot
   instead of the last and "Foo.v2.ips" stops being offered).

   In order:
     1. the extension is exactly "ips"/"bps"                     (patch_ext_type)
     2. the name starts with the ROM stem, case-insensitively    (istartswith)
     3. something follows that stem
     4. the patch's OWN stem is longer than the ROM's.

   Rule 4 is the one that needs explaining.  A patch whose name is the ROM stem plus
   nothing but an extension is INDISTINGUISHABLE from the patch that produced this ROM:
   "create patched ROM" writes <patch stem>.sfc, so the .ips that made it ends up
   sitting next to it under exactly that stem, and it would be offered again on every
   launch.  Re-applying an IPS over an already-patched image corrupts it -- IPS carries
   no checksum, source size or target size to defend itself (unlike BPS, whose CRCs are
   only read when CFG.patch_verify_integrity is on, and it is off by default).
   The legitimate "Foo.sfc + Foo.ips" convention loses out here; the Web Manager renames
   those to "Foo - Patch 1.ips" during its 2.15 card migration so nothing is lost.

   The test is EXACT, not a heuristic: patch_ext_type has already guaranteed a last dot
   with a 3-character extension, so the patch's stem length is strlen(fn)-4, and rule 2
   has already established that the first stem_len characters match.  Equal prefix plus
   equal length means the two stems are the same string. */

   The patcher writes ROM bytes through the MCU memory window while the SNES is
   held in reset.  Under an enhancement-chip FPGA core the MCU_RDY line can stay
   deasserted, which hangs the unbounded FPGA_WAIT_RDY forever (the reported
   stall).  These helpers bound every MCU_RDY wait with FPGA_WAIT_RDY_TO and
   latch patch_io_err on timeout; the apply loops poll patch_io_err and abort
   the patch cleanly (returning 0 -> the load fails) instead of wedging the MCU.

 * a headerless one by its record offsets alone -- guessing from offsets is
 * exactly the inverted heuristic that used to corrupt unheadered patches (see
 * the long comment in ips_apply below).  Instead of guessing we VALIDATE:
 * materialize the SNES internal header the final image would carry under each
 * hypothesis (literal vs shifted +512) from the base ROM already staged in
 * PSRAM plus the patch's own header-region records, and pick the coherent one.
 * Conservative: shift by 512 ONLY when the headered hypothesis yields a coherent
 * header AND the literal one does not, so a working (matched-convention) patch
 * -- e.g. Zelda: Parallel Worlds, which coheres literal -- is never touched.
 * The detection is FOLDED into ips_apply()'s pass-1 scan (below) so the IPS is
 * read only once; the helpers ips_hdr_overlay()/ips_hdr_coherent() do the work. */
