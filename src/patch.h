/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Layout of the patch list the MCU stages for the menu.  It lives in TWO
 * regions, and the split is forced by hardware, not taste:
 *
 *   SRAM_IPS_LIST_ADDR ($FF5000, 4096 B) -- the SNES-WRITABLE half
 *     +0                                 u8   num_patches (0..IPS_MAX_PATCHES)
 *     +1 .. +15                               reserved
 *     +IPS_FLAGS_BASE + N                u8   per-patch flags (PATCH_FLAG_*)
 *
 *   SRAM_IPS_TEXT_ADDR ($D90000, 64 KB)  -- read-only for the SNES
 *     +IPS_NAME_BASE  + N*IPS_NAME_LEN   64 B per-patch display slot:
 *                        +0 .. +41            display name, NUL-terminated
 *                        +IPS_NAME_BADGE(58)  "IPS"/"BPS" badge, NUL-terminated
 *     +IPS_PATH_BASE  + N*IPS_PATH_LEN  192 B full SD path, NUL-terminated
 *                                             (MCU-only, the menu never reads it)
 *
 * In menu mode the FPGA only lets the SNES WRITE banks $F0-$FF (address.v:
 * IS_SAVERAM = &SNES_ADDR[23:20] for mapper 7; IS_PATCH needs an unlock that only
 * the in-game hooks raise).  The flags byte is the one field the menu also writes
 * -- the Y context menu cycles the header mode -- so it has to stay at $FF5000
 * even though the names no longer fit there.  Do NOT "simplify" this back into
 * one region: the store would be swallowed and the override would silently never
 * persist.  SRAM_CHEAT_FLAGS_ADDR $FF0500 exists for exactly the same reason.
 *
 * Everything is in DISPLAY order (alphabetical), which is also the order the
 * 1-based index in MCU_PARAM+7 refers to.
 *
 * LOCKSTEP with the IPS_* defines in snes/memmap.i65 and with the layout comments
 * on SRAM_IPS_LIST_ADDR / SRAM_IPS_TEXT_ADDR (src/memory.h).  Changing any offset
 * here without the mirror makes the menu render garbage and the MCU open a junk
 * path.
 *
 * The display name is resolved by the MCU (yml Name: override, else the cleaned
 * suffix after the ROM stem) so the 65816 side only ever renders.  The badge
 * lives inside the name slot on purpose: "IPS"/"BPS" are language-neutral, so a
 * menu-side string would land in bank $C0, which is ~90% full.

 *   unheadered patches that touch the start of the ROM (e.g. Zelda Parallel
 *   Worlds).  Matching the patch's header convention to the ROM is the caller's
 *   job, the same as on a PC.
 *
