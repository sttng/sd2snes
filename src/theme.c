/* Font edge remaps: .thm header flags bit1/bit2 ask the MCU to edit the menu
   font's edge pixels, matching what the official editor does to the tiles it
   bakes into a menu.bin -- but WITHOUT the .thm carrying the font. The 2bpp
   font (slot 0) uses pixel value 1 = fill, 2 = the 1px outline ring, 3 = the
   anti-alias step between them:
     bit1 outline off: value 2 -> 0 (transparent), so the HDMA backdrop
                       gradient shows through where the ring was;
     bit2 AA off:      value 3 -> 1 (fill), so the glyph edge is hard.
   Both are applied to the PSRAM copy before the SNES runs its genfonts DMA;
   font.a65 and the ROM are untouched. Flags clear -> no-op.
   NB: the AA-off remap makes the edge hard regardless of the palette. The
   Theme Creator ALSO writes shade 0x03 as the group's own text colour for the
   same effect on firmware that predates this flag; the two agree, so a theme
   built either way looks the same here.

   The same two remaps are also user options (CFG.text_outline /
   CFG.text_antialias), and those apply with OR without a theme. The two sources
   compose by OR -- the user toggle only ever turns an edge OFF in addition to
   what the theme asked for, so a theme that wants no ring keeps its look even
   with the toggles left on. That is why the remap does NOT run inside
   theme_apply anymore: it is theme_font_edges() (called from main.c right after
   theme_apply) that combines the file flags published in theme_font_flags with
   the config, so the "no theme" path gets the toggles too. */
